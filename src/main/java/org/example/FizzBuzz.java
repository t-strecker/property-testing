    FizzBuzz

You need to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n such that:

  * If the number is a multiple of 3, you need to print "Fizz" instead of that number.
  * If the number is a multiple of 5, you need to print "Buzz" instead of that number.
  * If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, you need to print "FizzBuzz" instead of that number.
